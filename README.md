Geoffrey Hinton – Modern AI Father AI & Robotics – First Session Notes

Geoffrey Hinton – Godfather of AI
Geoffrey Hinton is known as the “Godfather of AI.”

He received the Nobel Prize in Physics (2024) from the Royal Swedish Academy.

His main contribution: Neural Networks & Deep Learning.

Artificial Intelligence (AI)
Definition: The ability of a machine or computer to think and learn like a human.

AI learns from data and improves over time without explicit programming.

Example: Teaching a child to recognize cats, dogs, or birds → similarly, AI learns patterns.

Neural Networks
Neural Network: A machine learning model that mimics the human brain.

Works by connecting nodes (artificial neurons) similar to biological neurons.

Uses these connections to identify, decide, and predict.

Biological Neural Network
Neurons: Billions of nerve cells in the brain.

Dendrites: Receive signals from other neurons.

Axons: Transmit signals to other neurons or muscles.

Synapse: Junction between axon of one neuron and dendrite of another.

Function: Process and send electrochemical signals.

Core AI Concepts
Data → Information (raw facts → useful meaning)

Model → Representation (system showing how things work)

Train → Learning (model improves by studying data)

Test → Evaluation (checking model performance)

Robotics & AI
Robotics integrates AI to make machines intelligent.

Robots can sense, learn, and act in real-world environments.

Applications: Industry, Healthcare, Education, Daily Life.
